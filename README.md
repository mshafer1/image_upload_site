# Image Upload Site

## Why?

Several years ago, I helped with a wedding where the bride and groom wanted to have the guests send them any pictures they took.

To make this simple, I made a website that had a "click to select pictures" screen and then uploaded the pictures to the groom's server.

Now, I am helping with another wedding and the couple is considering the same idea; however, I cannot find the source for that original website at this point. On top of that, it was written in PHP, which I try to avoid these days due to how easy it is to have a security hole.

Some of the features I liked from the example I worked from then were:
- simple "click here" upload form
- during upload, a preview of the image was shown with a progress bar

This project is me taking Flask + tutorials online and building that functionality on a more modern language with security in mind.
